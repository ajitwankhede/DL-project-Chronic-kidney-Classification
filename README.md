Tack:
Build deep learning base Image classification model which able to classify, CT scan image of kidney and identify kidney with tumour and Normal kidney.
Dataset:
I am using dataset of Kidney CT Scan image, which is identified and classified as kidney with tumour and Normal kidney with respective to image.
For example:

**Normal kidney**

 **Tumour Kidney**
